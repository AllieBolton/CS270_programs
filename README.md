## Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

The contents of this repository were crated for the purpose of working with the text *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.*
Here you will find HTML and CSS files that display a portion of the text online in my html file and some incomplete Scala files created with the ultimate goal of enumerating types of nouns found in *Alice* (I don't recommend using those).
My Attic holds various files from homework assignments and practices. They served mainly as personal learning tools but you may use them if you find a practical application.
