One specifies a length and unit for their n-grams and all repeating patterns fitting these specifications are located in the given text. This can be used in a variety of ways under various disciplines:

  - in statistics to predict what is likely to come next in a text (e.g. predictive text on phones)
  - in business for finding and promoting positive online comments made about their service.
  - in science for finding particular genes and genetic sequences in string of DNA.
  - etc. etc.
